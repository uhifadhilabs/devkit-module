 * Where a package is switched on across the fleet — classified from what the

 *
 * `TheCore` — the core package, which is on in nothing because it is not a
 * module. `HostWide` — infrastructure (a package with no module provider) and
 * base modules (a provider that answers base(): seeded active in every area).
 * `PerArea` — an installable capability module, switched on per area by an admin.
 *
 * THE EXACT PER-AREA COUNT ("on in 1 / 4") IS DEFERRED. It needs the registry's
 * per-area ledger (a database read) AND the host's list of areas to divide by,
 * neither of which the standalone console has; see {@see ModuleRegistry}. The
 * reach here is the honest DB-free classification, not the count.
